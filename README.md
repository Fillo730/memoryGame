🌿 Memory Game
Memory Game is a browser-based card-matching game inspired by the calming beauty of the natural world. This project is built using modern web technologies including React and Astro for the front end, and Express (Node.js) for the back end.
Players are presented with a grid of cards featuring real nature images (e.g., landscapes, animals, forests, etc.) and must find matching pairs to complete the game.

🎯 Features
🖼️ Beautiful Nature Imagery – Cards feature high-quality, royalty-free nature images.

⚛️ Modern Front-End – Built with React components inside Astro, ensuring fast, optimized rendering.

🔄 State Management – Smooth flip animations and score tracking using React state.

🔧 Back-End API – Basic game logic routes implemented with Express.js (Node.js).

🧪 Modular Architecture – Cleanly separated front end and back end for scalability.

🗃️ MongoDB Database Integration – A MongoDB database is now integrated to support future features like saving scores or user progress.
