🌿 Memory Game
Memory Game is a browser-based card-matching game inspired by the calming beauty of the natural world. This project is built using modern web technologies including React and Astro for the front-end and Express (Node.js) for the back-end.
Players are presented with a grid of cards featuring real nature images (e.g., landscapes, animals, forests, etc.) and must find matching pairs to complete the game.

🎯 Features
🖼️ Beautiful Nature Imagery – Cards feature high-quality, royalty-free nature images.

⚛️ Modern Front-End – Built with React components inside Astro, ensuring fast, optimized rendering.

🔄 State Management – Smooth flip animations and score tracking using React state.

🔧 Backend API – Basic game logic routes implemented with Express.js (Node.js).

🧪 Modular Architecture – Cleanly separated front-end and back-end for scalability.
