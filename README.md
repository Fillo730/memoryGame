Nature Memory Game is a browser-based card-matching game inspired by the calming beauty of the natural world. This project is built using modern web technologies including React and Astro for the front-end and Express (Node.js) for the back-end.
Players are presented with a grid of cards featuring real nature images (e.g., landscapes, animals, forests, etc.) and must find matching pairs to complete the game.
